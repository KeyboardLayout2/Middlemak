# Middlemak
Middlemak Keyboard Layout
This is an alternate keyboard layout to Qwerty, named for the emphasis on the middle finger and use of the middle-finger-upper-row locations for frequent letters

The main design criteria was:

1) Use the middle-finger-upper-row position. The middle finger is a very strong finger, and the middle-finger-upper-row is a very good location for a common letter. 

2) To reduce pinballing by putting most vowels on the right hand and putting most of the frequent consonants on the left hand.

3) Reduce the number of Near Finger Bigrams (NFBs).

4) Improve hand balance.

5) Keep SFB down of course. 

6) A secondary design criteria was low ring-to-pinky-rolls. I find this to be an awkward movement.

7) Maintain Qwerty similarity to make it easier to learn.

These are all discussed in more detail below. (I’ll be talking in the context of Colemak for some of it. I don’t mean this to be a hit piece on Colemak, it’s just the best way to frame the items.)

### 1) Middle-Finger-Upper-Row

The main purpose of this layout is to place 2 common letters on the middle-finger-upper-row. The middle finger is very strong and these are excellent locations that are easy to reach.

When you look at the letter frequency, there are 11 common letters before it takes a big drop off. The first eight letters go on the home row under the fingers. The next question is where do the next 3 letters go. Middlemak’s philosophy is to place 2 on the middle-finger-upper-row, and 1 on the index-finger-upper-row. Colemak places 2 on the centre columns, requiring a lateral movement that many find uncomfortable. Workman has 1 middle-finger-upper-row, 1 ring-finger-upper-row, and 1 index-finger-lower-row, a mixed bag.

L pairs well with R for low SFB. Middlemak places the RL column on the middle finger, which puts the common L on the middle-finger-upper-row.

E and O pair very well for low SFB. Placing EO column on the middle finger puts the very common O on the middle-finger-upper-row.

Using the middle finger also unloads the index fingers. The index fingers can get very busy with 6-7 letters compared with the other letters 3, especially when multiple frequent letters are put on them. I’ll give the distance stats in “Excessive amounts of stats” section far below which shows the drastic difference.

(I’ll skip discussing D here, it’s in “Excessive amounts of detail”. I also cover the R position more there.)

### 2) Pinballing.

I wrote about pinballing in length [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Norman/wiki/index#wiki_my_personal_ponderings). The short of it is that there is an incredibly strong interaction between vowels and the consonants, with 75% of all bigrams between vowels and consonants. PInballing can happen when a lot of vowels and consonants arn put on the same hand, the hand movement will pinball back and forth between the vowels and consonants.

I’ll cover Colemak first to outline the issue. Having most of the vowels EOIUY and many frequent  consonants of NHLMKJ on the right hand leads to a pinballing problem. I call this the NHLMKJ wall, it’s a wall of consonants that the vowels pinball off of

To reduce pinballing Middlemak does two things:

First Middlemak moves L off the vowel hand and to the consonant hand. This (and moving H) reduces the wall to NMFPJ which is much, much lower frequency for movements to pinball off of. Or if the word starts with NMFPJ, it’s again much lower frequency.

Second it moves H to the pinky. H is a very unique letter because it’s almost always followed by a vowel. Moving H to the pinky means it almost always gives an inside roll.  After the vowel, it generally continues to the consonants NMFPJ continuing the inside roll, or it alternates to the other hand. Rarely goes back to H. Generally only after the third letter can it *start* to pinball back to the vowels or back to H. 

Combined, this reduces pinballing and increases alternating. It’s not entirely alternating, Middlemak still has rolls because it has N, H, and MKFJ. For N I find the rolls to be comfortable, likely because N is on the home row.


### 3) Near Finger Bigrams, NFB

NFB are bigrams that are on adjacent fingers. Too many or an uncomfortable arrangement can be an issue. 
NFB and pinballing are separate issues: NFB is the smaller pattern of adjacent fingers, pinballing is the much larger pattern of pinballing between all vowels and constants.

I’ll cover Colemak first again to highlight the issue. On Colemak there are extremely common NFBs with HE and LE/EL. (There is also NE/EN, but I find the HE and EL/LE to be awkward because L and H are not on the home row.)

Pretty much all E bigrams are fairly high. I think you want to move common consonants away from E to reduce NFBs. For Middlemak, that means moving them away from the EO column. 

Middlemak drastically reduces the NFBs by moving the common letters L and H off the adjacent index finger. The replacements of F and Y have dramatically lower NFBs with E and O. I wanted to keep Colemak’s K there since this doesn’t have many bigrams with E and O.

Looking at other layouts: Workman still has high NFB with L and E. Colemak-DH maintains L and H next to E. Many find the new HE roll to be more comfortable but it’s still a ton of NFB, and LE/EL is still there. MTGAP moved practically all letters away from its E and O and instead put punctuation there, a very good solution.

Middlemak does create some NFB with O placement. Namely OF, ON, and OM. However OF and ON are very comfortable, having the middle finger extended up feels pretty comfortable. OM is ok, and it’s the least common of those 3. The OM scissor-gram is a bit more common than I'd like, but it feels ok. This is about the best location for a scissor-gram too, with the long-middle-finger up and the curl-index-finger down being able to handle it fairly well. (Just to mention Colemak’s EL/LE, not exactly a scissor-gram, I find is bad since the shorter index finger has to reach up and the middle finger is so long it’s already curled just to be on the home row.)

Overall, Middlemak moving common consonants away from E drastically lowers the number of NFBs and takes away a ton of awkward movements. Visually, I think you can see this pretty easily in the heatmaps.

(You can extend this concept to fingers further away, to include Colemaks HI, LI, etc. This can be valid, but for here I’ll focus on adjacent fingers.)

### 4) Hand balance

Hand balance is a difficult topic. The two most obvious metrics for hand dominance are 1) the frequency of the letters, and 2) the distance the fingers have to travel (which is different from frequency because you don't travel to the home-row). But any pinballing from having too many vowels and consonants on the same hand doesn’t show up in those numbers. Having said all that, I’m going to look at frequency and distance. 

Keyboard|Vowel Hand|Dominant Hand|Hand Balance ratio based on Frequency|Hand Balance ratio based on Distance|Hand Balance ratio based on Frequency **and** Distance|Corrected comparison number for left hand dominant
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--
MTGAP|Left|Right|1.00|1.43|1.43|
Workman|Right|Left|0.97|0.82|0.80|1.26
Norman|n/a|Right|0.93|1.27|1.19|
Colemak|Right|Right|1.14|1.15|1.32|
Middlemak|Right|Right|1.05|1.06|1.11|
Semimak|Right|Right|1.15|1.30|1.49|
Dvorak|Left|Right|1.23|1.86|2.30|
QWERTY|n/a|Left|0.77|1.06|0.82|1.22

Notes: Ratio >1 indicates right hand dominant, <1 indicates left hand dominant. The hand balance ratios are based on each hand's frequency/distance, right hand divided by left hand. E.g. Middlemak: 51.2% right hand frequency divided by 48.8% left hand frequency equals 1.05. Colemak: 53.2% right hand frequency divided by 46.7% left hand frequency equals 1.14. Hand Balance ratio based on Frequency *and* Distance is a simple multiplication of the two ratios. I did this because having more frequency *and* more movement on the same hand amplifies the hand dominance. Or if one hand has more frequency and the other hand has more movement, that would mitigate it to some degree. This is by no means the most definitive way to look at it, but it's what I've managed to come up with. The "Corrected comparison number for left hand dominant" is a hard math thing to explain (that I hope I'm right about anyway). E.g. for Workman listing 0.80 gives the wrong impression the hand dominance is equivalent to 1.2 (20%). But it's actually 1.26 (26%), obtained from 1/0.796=1.26. 

Middlemak is more balanced on both frequency and distance. When both are considered, it really adds up to being more balanced. Middlemak combined balance ratio is 1.11, compared to Colemak’s 1.32 or Workman’s 1.26.

Ratios can change quite quickly because both the numerator and the denominator (in this case, the left and right hand) can go in opposite directions. Moving L to the other hand does exactly this - changing both the numerator and denominator, and it changes both the frequency and the distance. So that one move really helps to balance out the hands.

(I’ll add the full data in “Excessive amounts of stats” for both frequency and distance, broken down to hands and fingers. The individual finger load is quite interesting too.)

### 5) SFB

The SFB of this layout is still pretty low, but it does come out a tad higher than Colemak’s. I’ve debated how to show this and decided to go with the full nuclear information. Data is from Mayzner revisited in millions (which only has letter bigrams and doesn’t have punctuation data, that’s what the 0’s are).

Keyboard|Total SFB|Left hand SFB|Right hand SFB|L Pinky|L Ring|L Middle|L Index|R Index|R Middle|R Ring|R Pinky
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--
QWERTY|185,270|125,920|59,350|1,105|1,661|54,502|68,651|34,166|3,970|21,214|0
Workman|78,147|29,268|48,878|1,105|3,712|2,806|21,645|27,338|5,037|16,503|0
Dvorak|70,570|28,306|42,264|0|31|0|28,275|12,142|16,265|8,229|5,629
**Middlemak**|**44,698**|**25,806**|**18,892**|**1,105**|**1,661**|**2,716**|**20,323**|**12,415**|**3,134**|**3,343**|**0**
Colemak|39,023|23,336|15,687|1,105|1,267|639|20,323|9,831|5,037|819|0
MTGAP|34,151|14,550|19,601|1,147|339|3,134|9,931|4,629|8,633|5,071|1,267

Notes: This is with index finger pressing C location, how I think most people type. Adding in punctuation the numbers would be higher, I expect they would increase by similar absolute amounts.

For Middlemak: You can see it’s not all that much of an increase in SFB from Colemak. Overall the numbers are low considering it keeps many Qwerty aspects.

On the left hand: The middle finger goes up with R and L. This was to allow more consonants on the left hand and use of the middle-finger-upper-row. I think the middle finger being a strong finger and comfortable reach can handle these quite well. The index finger is the same as Colemak.

On the right hand: The right index goes up a little bit, mostly with NY and MY. They aren’t as high as you may think. But the Y SFBs and adding in NK/KN, NF, etc, they do add up a little. It’s not all that much but it is more. I think it’s still easily manageable. NY is actually not all that common, for example it’s actually less common than EU/UE. (The exact Mayzner numbers are: NY/YN is 2,761 / 373. Compared to EU/UE is 878 / 4,158. MY/YM is 1,753 / 668.) The middle finger actually goes down, EO/OE is very low. The ring finger goes up a bit with UI/IU being more common than Colemak’s IY/YI. 

If you want overall percentages (index finger pressing C), Middlemak comes in at 2.078%, vs Colemak’s 1.815%, vs Workmans 3.053%, vs Qwerty’s 6.264%.

Colemak really did a good job finding low SFB pairings of SF, DT, NHL, RW, and IY. So changing 3 of those pairings does come at a cost. But it’s really not much and it’s done so that Middlemak can put more frequent letters to better spots, reduce pinballing, and reduce NFB. I think the SFB is in the same realm as Colemak, it’s still pretty low.

Notes: This is with the *middle* finger pressing C location, “proper” or ortho style. Same data as above.

Middlemak on Ortho actually comes in just a tad lower, but Colemak takes a bigger dip.

This basically moves most of the SFB from the index finger to the middle finger. On Middlemak, ortho takes out CT on the index finger and puts in CR and CL on the middle finger, which is only a tad lower. On Colemak, ortho takes out CT and puts in SC which is much lower.

I think it still works well. The middle finger is a strong finger and can cover most of these well. The one issue is that CL which is a two row jump.

I’ll break down the full Mayzner numbers:

First the index finger pressing CT/TC is 12,998 / 737. This is what ortho *removes*.

Middlemak Ortho puts in CR/RC which is 4,214 / 3,423. And puts in CL / LC which is 4,202 / 333. In percentages, CR is 32% of CT, RC is 26% of CT, and CL is 32% of CT. Adding it all up and including all the others (CP, CG, etc), Middlemak Ortho comes in at 87% of CT+TC. Just a tad lower.

Colemak Ortho puts in CS/SC, which is 644 / 4,363. CF/ FC is pretty much nill. In percentages, SC is 34% of CT. Adding it all up and including the others, Colemak Ortho comes in at 36% of CT+TC. A big dip.

If you want overall percentages (middle finger pressing C, Ortho style), Middlemak comes in at 2.16%, vs Colemak’s 1.669%, vs Workman’s 3.147%, vs Qwerty’s 6.575%. This is from Colemak-DH analyzer which says Middlemak ortho increases, as opposed to what I found that Middlemak ortho decreases SFB. I think it comes down to the data set used.

### 6) Low ring-to-pinky rolls. And the amazing inside roll from H.

A secondary design goal was to decrease the awkward ring-to-pinky roll. Middlemak greatly reduces this roll. 

On the left hand: Middlemak’s ring-to-pinky outside roll of SA and WA is actually pretty low. SA is actually the lowest bigram of the common consonants to A. So SA and WA comes out to be a good design. Compared to Colemak, Middlemak’s SA outside roll is far less common than Colemak’s RA. (The exact Mayzner in millions are: Middlemak’s SA is 6,147. Colemak’s RA is 19,333. WA is the same for both at 10,865.)

On the right hand: Middlmak’s ring-to-pinky roll of IH and UH is very low. Vs Colemak: IO is very common and even YO is pretty common. (The exact numbers are Middlemak’s IH is 59, UH is 30. Vs Colemak’s IO 23,542, YO is 4,227.)

This next bit isn’t even a secondary design goal, but it’s worth mentioning: On the right hand, outside rolls from any of the fingers to the pinky H are very low. The common letters that come before H are usually TH, CH, WH, SH, and GH. All of those are on the opposite left hand. Doing the math, 97% of the letters before H are on the left hand. H on the pinky gives an amazing inside roll almost all the time. 

Also worth mentioning is I think this also de-emphasizes the pinky a bit. First it limits the ring-to-pinky rolls. Second, the frequency of H is much lower than Colemak’s O. Third, the bigram HH is virtually nill, vs Colemak’s OO which is pretty common. None of these are massive,  but I think they add up to de-emphasizing the pinky a bit.

### 7) Qwerty similarity.

Last but not least, this maintains Qwerty similarity to make it easier to learn. 

First, this maintains the bottom row (except N) and maintains Q, W, A, and S. Many letters move on the same finger, including T, G, N, Y, J .

Second, this “keeps” the ASRT order. People learning Colemak commonly say that R and S are reversed. Technically it’s not because R was never on the middle finger to begin with. But it seems to be reversed in the brain. I think it’s two things. First ASRT keeps it in the same order, with R between S and T, even if R changes fingers. Second, I wonder how many people alt-fingered R typing in Qwerty, either all the time or for the RT bigram.

(I've also wondered if, for example, patterns like the very common ION simply being easier to type would make this faster to learn. I’m not certain about that though.)

Comparing layouts:

- Middlemak: 10 letters stay in their original spot and 16 move, with 5 letters moving on the same finger and 11 letters switching fingers.

- Colemak: 10 letters stay in their original spot and 16 move, with 4 letters moving on the same finger and 12 letters switching fingers.

- Colemak-DH: 5 letters stay in their original spot and 21 move, with 6 letters moving on the same finger and 15 letters switching fingers.

- Workman: 6 letters stay in their original spot and 20 move, with 8 letters moving on the same finger and 12 letters switching fingers.

*Not accounting for punctuation changes.

Considering letters swapping on the same finger, this has fewer changes than Colemak. And I think “keeping” the ASRT order will make it even easier to adopt than the numbers suggest.

(I hope people don’t think that I’m overly focused on keeping S in the Qwerty location just because. For this layout, it does work better with ASRT, I address it in more detail in excessive amount of details.)


### Downsides

1) There is a slight increase in SFB compared to Colemak. But overall I think SFB is still low. 

2) There are a handful of NFB with R: BR, GR, PR, etc. Same with L and BL. This isn’t enough to change the home row to ARST. There is more below but ASRT has lower SFB, lower ring-to-pinky rolls, and is easier to learn. Also note these are much, much lower than the extremely high NFB that Colemak has with HE, LE, etc, (to solve those I paid L and R together).

3) I wanted a less common letter in the G location (Qwerty T location). I really tried to put a less common letter there, but it simply didn’t work.

4) I mention this above but to add more: The OM scissor-gram is a bit more common than I'd like. This is a limitation of keeping Qwerty similarity (the M) and wanting to put O on the upper-row-middle-finger. (MTGAP has a good design on this. It paired its EO with a lot of punctuation on the index finger to reduce NFBs.)

### Conclusion

I'm really happy with this layout. I think it is a great combination of pretty low SFB, good use of the strong middle-finger-upper-row position, reduced NFB and pinballing, keeping Qwerty similarity, and easy to transition to.

Honestly I’m surprised no one else has stumbled on this arrangement, since many people have taken to trying to fix Colemak’s issues and keep Qwerty similarity.

### Some nice rolls and combinations

Although this increases alternating, there are still plenty of rolls left. Some I want to mention:

HE is very easy.

LD feels very good.

OU feels very comfortable.

OF/FO is very common and feels very good.

IO and ION are very nice rolls.

This maintains the nice IEN roll.

IOU is a redirect, but overall feels pretty ok.

YOU has a lateral move, but feels comfortable.

OU+LD together to make OULD feels good. 

The very common TH, THE, and THE_ feel very nice not having to move the fingers off the home row.

### Vs Colemak and Vs Colemak-DH

I made Middlemak to try to solve the problems I found with Colemak. I think all the items came out above, but as a bit of a summary and to include Colemak-DH.

Colemak:

1) Colemak has an issue with high lateral movement with D and H. You see this especially with H and its NFBs, but D isn’t the best either.

2) Colemak’s right index finger is overworked. It just has too much to do with N, H, and L.

3) Colemak has a pinballing issue due to placing most vowels and many common consonants on the same hand.

4) Colemak has a ton of NFB with EL/LE and HE. 

5) Colemak has a hand balance issue. It places a lot of emphasis on the right hand with the vowels and several common consonants. (Hand dominance and pinballing are technically separate items.)

6) Colemak’s awkward ring-to-pinky rolls. Notably IO, YO (especially when typing YOU), and also RA on the right hand.

7) Not exactly a direct issue with Colemak, but Middlemak is easier to learn coming from Qwerty. Many new users want to ‘keep’ the order of ASRT instead of ‘reversing’ S and R.

Middlemak is a pretty low increase in SFBs and it fixes those issues. 

Colemak DH:

Colemak-DH solves 1) the lateral movements. But it doesn’t solve 2) the right index finger overwork, 3) the pinballing, 4) the NFBs 5) the hand balance, 6) the awkward ring-to-pinky rolls, and 7) coming from Qwerty it’s pretty much a full change layout, taking out ease of transition. This also means common shortcuts move. They are still accessible, but they move (paste is the same. Undo, cut, and copy move.)

### Option: Swap A and H 

This gives:

    QWLDG JFOU:
    HSRTP YNEIA
    ZXCVB KM,./

The good: This is good if you want to put all the vowels and most consonants on opposite hands. Overall this increases alternating. This mostly comes from moving A to the right hand because A pairs a lot with the L, R, S, T, etc. This is the biggest appeal if you find those uncomfortable. Moving H actually decreases alternating because there’s a high bigram with TH (you can test your own comfortability on that. Don’t forget capitalized Th is common.) Excessive details: Middlemak A has 41% of bigrams on the opposite hand, swapping gives 65%. Middlemak H has 58% of bigrams on the opposite hand, swapping gives 51% (again, mostly because of TH). Overall, middlemak A+H has 48% on the opposite hand, swapping gives 59%.

The neutral: On the left hand, the ring-to-pinky outside roll of SH is slightly higher, but in a similar range. Data from Mayzner is SH is 8,889, and original is SA is 6,147. Changing WA to WH is practically identical. 

The bad: On both the right and left hand, the all-fingers-to-pinky outside roll is higher. On the left hand, it’s because TH is very common. On the right hand, it takes away the remarkable inside roll of H and adds in a moderate number of all-fingers-to-A bigrams with EA, IA, NA, MA, etc, (OA is actually low). Notably, the ring-to-pinky outside roll is higher with IA and UA coming in at 8,072 and 3,844, vs original IH and UH of 59 and 30.

The complicated: This option decreases the pinky-to-all-fingers rolls inside rolls on both hands. It increases the all-fingers-to-pinky rolls outside rolls. The overall sum of inside rolls *plus* outside rolls is lower. In short: this option lowers inside rolls, increases outside rolls, with an overall sum that is lower.

Basically stick to the original if you want to lower ring-to-pinky movement, lower outside rolls, and easier to learn. Overall I put this as a decent option if someone wants to maximize alternating without going to a full change layout.

#Excessive amount of stats

This section has details on distance reductions, hand balance based on frequency, hand balance based on distance, and raw distance numbers. I'm going to give lots of charts to cover all the details. Those that want to know all the details or those that like to analyze will find this interesting, but others don’t have to read. 

### Distance reduction from Qwerty

Keyboard|Distance|Distance|Distance
:--|:--|:--|:--
||(km)|(miles)|(% reduction from Qwerty)
MTGAP|2.592|1.611|46.3%
Workman|2.613|1.624|45.9%
Norman|2.615|1.625|45.9%
Colemak|2.616|1.625|45.8%

Semimak|2.739|1.702|43.3%
Dvorak|2.813|1.748|41.8%
QWERTY|4.829|3.001|0%

*Source: 62 page / 31k word compilation. Left index used to press Qwerty C location. Includes punctuation. 

Middlemak’s distance reduction is good, most alt keyboards are in the same range. It’s a tad worse on distance than some others because putting O off the home row increases distance, with the O being more frequent. (MTGAP puts O off the home row, but has all the punctuation on the diagonals to decrease distance.)

### All Finger Distances

This is the raw distance travelled in metres. Percentages rely on the total distance travelled, which changes between layouts so it's not comparable. Note that distance is different from frequency. The fingers don't move for the home row, the distance travelled is to the other letters.

*All distances in metres. Same source as table above.

First, you can see Qwerty’s distances are extremely high. All the alternatives make big reductions.

Notice that the index fingers move *way* more than the other fingers.

Middlemak balances this out decently and moves more distance to both middle fingers. The left index finger is still a bit high because it has D off the home row (this brings it back to the discussion of where does the 11th letter go). Middlemak’s left index is slightly higher than Colemak’s even though they have the same letters because the row stagger *technically* puts D on a slight diagonal. A technicality really.

The right index finger is low, a good feature that the index finger next to the vowels doesn’t have to travel much. Compared to Colemak, Middlemak’s movement is 41% lower than Colemaks.

###Zoom in on index fingers

Keyboard|Distance|Distance|Total|Index Finger % of total distance
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--
||L Index |R Index|L+R Index|L+R Index
MTGAP|246|667|913 m|35%
Workman|753|505|1259 m|48%
Norman|674|525|1200 m|46%
Colemak|842|747|1589 m|61%
**Middlemak**|**847**|**440**|**1287 m**|**47%**
Semimak|390|506|896 m|33%
Dvorak|692|753|1445 m|51%
QWERTY|1413|1169|2582 m|53%

Here you can really see how much work the index fingers do. Middlemak’s sum of the index fingers is nice and low.

You can also look at the percentage of travel with the index finger. Middlemak’s is down at 47% - meaning the index fingers are responsible for 47% of all the distance travelled. On Colemak the index fingers account for 61% the distance travelled, quite a big difference relatively. Workman and Norman are close to Middlemak. MTGAP and Semimak are very low. Dvorak and Qwerty percentages are a bit deceiving though - the higher index finger distances are hidden by the higher total amount of distance.

So even when Middlemak’s left index finger doesn’t have a reduction in distance, the total index finger distance is significantly reduced.

### Hand Balance based on Distance

This is the distance in percentages for all the fingers (unlike the raw distances in metres above) so that I can add them up to look at hand balance.

Keyboard|Left hand|Right hand|Hand Balance Ratio|L Pinky|L Ring|L Middle|**L Index**|**R Index**|R Middle|R Ring|R Pinky
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--
MTGAP|41.2*|58.8|1.43|11.3|4.5|15.9|9.5|25.7|12.3|8.4|12.3
Workman|55.0|45.0*|0.82|4.7|8.9|12.6|28.8|19.3|7.6|5.6|12.5
Norman|44.0|56.0|1.27|4.8|4.8|8.5|25.8|20.1|14.4|9.3|12.2
Colemak|46.4|53.6*|1.15|5.0|4.8|4.4|32.2|28.6|7.6|5.4|12.0
**Middlemak**|**48.5**|**51.5***|**1.06**|**5.0**|**4.7**|**7.6**|**31.2**|**16.3**|**17.0**|**7.0**|**11.3**
Semimak|43.5|56.5*|1.30|8.7|8.7|11.9|14.2|18.5|7.3|16.4|14.4
Dvorak|35.0*|65.0|1.86|7.3|1.9|1.2|24.6|26.8|10.1|14.0|14.1
QWERTY|48.5|51.5|1.06|2.7|2.6|13.9|29.3|24.2|9.4|9.3|8.7

Notes: * indicates vowel hand (Norman and Qwerty are mixed enough that there is no clear vowel hand). The ratio between the hands can change quite quickly, so I think that highlights the differences between the layouts better. Ratio >1 indicates right hand dominant, <1 indicates left hand dominant.

I think the raw distances are better for comparison between layouts, but some people like percentages. I used this mostly to calculate hand balance.

You can see Middlemak spreads out the work. The pinkies are low, ring fingers are reasonable, middle takes on more, and the indexes have most of the distances. 

### Hand Balance based on Frequency

Now we’re shifting to frequency. You can see the data for all the fingers, this is enlightening on its own. I also add them up to look at the hand balance.

Keyboard|Left hand|Right hand|Hand Balance Ratio|L Pinky|L Ring|L Middle|**L Index**|**R Index**|R Middle|R Ring|R Pinky
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--
MTGAP|49.9*|50.0|1.00|10.8|8.4|18.8|11.9|16.3|14.5|9.8|9.4
Workman|50.7|49.3*|0.97|9.3|10.1|11.1|20.2|15.2|14.9|9.7|9.5
Norman|51.7|48.3|0.93|9.3|8.3|15.4|18.7|15.2|13.2|11.8|8.1
Colemak|46.7|53.2*|1.14|9.4|7.7|8.2|21.4|19.4|14.9|9.1|9.8
**Middlemak**|**48.8**|**51.2***|**1.05**|**9.4**|**8.3**|**9.7**|**21.4**|**13.7**|**19.6**|**9.9**|**8.0**
Semimak|46.6|53.4*|1.15|9.7|10.1|11.8|15.0|12.2|14.9|15.6|10.7
Dvorak|44.8*|55.3|1.23|10.3|8.1|12.2|14.2|17.2|13.4|13.0|11.7
QWERTY|56.5|43.5|0.77|9.4|8.3|15.4|23.4|18.8|8.4|11.8|4.5

\* indicates vowel hand (Norman and Qwerty are mixed enough that there is no vowel hand). Ratio of >1 indicates right hand dominant, <1 indicates left hand dominant.

The ratio between the hands can change quite quickly, so I think that highlights the differences between the layouts better than the percentages. I know it doesn't add up to 100%, the analyzer is doing some rounding or something behind the scenes, I'm not going to round any further. 

E is so common that it bumps up any finger it’s on. 

Middlemak’s left middle finger takes on a bit more work. The left index is still high because of D. The right index is notably lower taking off common letters. The right middle takes on more of the work with O. And the right pinky is lower too with the H there. 

##Hand Balance Distance + Frequency

This is the same chart that was above, just for a summary.

Keyboard|Dominant Hand|Hand Balance ratio based on Frequency|Hand Balance ratio based on Distance|Hand Balance ratio based on Frequency **and** Distance|Corrected comparison number for left hand dominant
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--
MTGAP|Right|1.00|1.43|1.43|
Workman|Left|0.97|0.82|0.80|1.26
Norman|Right|0.93|1.27|1.19|
Colemak|Right|1.14|1.15|1.32|
Middlemak|Right|1.05|1.06|1.11|
Semimak|Right|1.15|1.30|1.49|
Dvorak|Right|1.23|1.86|2.30|
QWERTY|Left|0.77|1.06|0.82|1.22

>1 indicates right hand dominant, <1 indicates left hand dominant. Hand Balance ratio based on Frequency **and** Distance is a simple multiplication of the two.

####Frequency-off-home-row (F.O.H.R.)

At the risk of too much information, another way to look at this is the frequency that’s off-home-row. I.e. the frequency that is not under the fingers.

Distances weigh the keys differently, while frequency-off-home-row levels that field. This should be read in conjunction with distance. Neither is better than the other, it’s just a different measurement.

Keyboard|L Pinky|L Ring|L Middle|**L Index**|**R Index**|R Middle|R Ring|R Pinky|L+R Index|Index FOHR as % of All fingers FOHR
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--
MTGAP|4.0|2.0|7.2|**4.1**|**10.8**|5.8|3.6|3.8|14.9%|36%
Workman|1.5|3.9|5.6|**11.5**|**8.8**|3.3|2.5|2.7|20.3%|51%
Norman|1.5|2.1|3.8|**10.0**|**8.8**|6.4|4.6|2.6|18.8%|47%
Colemak|1.6|2.1|2.0|**12.7**|**13.0**|3.3|2.3|2.6|25.7%|65%
**Middlemak**|**1.6**|**2.1**|**4.1**|**12.7**|**7.3**|**8.0**|**3.1**|**2.5**|**20.0%**|**48%**
Semimak|3.5|4.5|5.4|**6.3**|**8.4**|3.3|7.8|3.9|14.7%|34%
Dvorak|2.5|0.9|0.6|**11.7**|**11.7**|4.7|6.6|5.5|23.4%|53%
QWERTY|1.6|2.1|11.6|**21.4**|**18.6**|7.5|7.8|4.5|40.0%|53%

I did this after noticing, on Colemak, that my right index finger moves off the home row a lot. For Colemak the left index finger has more distance, but the right index finger has more frequency-off-home-row. The long distance to B on the left hand skews the distance travelled.

The effect is similar on most of the layouts: FOHR tones down the left hand dominance and bumps up the right hand dominance. With Colemak the frequency of H and L is enough to actually flip them. This is more noticeable with layouts that keep Qwerty’s B (which is just frequent enough to skew things), layouts that change the letter to a less common one shift less. 

Also insightful is “Index FOHR as % of All fingers FOHR”. It shows that on Middlemak the index fingers do 48% of all frequency-off-home-row, quite reasonable. Whereas on Colemak the index fingers have 65% of all frequency-off-home-row, very high. Workman is just a tad higher with the index fingers doing 51% of frequency-off-home-row. Dvorak’s and Qwerty’s 53% for index fingers is a bit deceiving though, it appears low but that's because the overall total FOHR is much higher.

This is similar to “Zoom in on the index fingers”, but this shows an even greater difference between Middlemak and Colemak. This shows Middlemak at 48% and Colemak at 65% based on index finger % of total FOHR. Recall Middlemaks was 47% and Colemaks was 61% based on index finger % of total distance. Same thing, when the distances to the diagonals are levelled out, the frequency stands out.

##Excessive amount of detail on letters

You really don’t need to read this, mostly if you have any lingering or specific Q on specific letters.

### D position and why not curl?

Back to the discussion of there being 11 common letters: Where to place that 11th letter is difficult, it’s either the ring finger or index finger. Many find the ring finger to not be very dexterous for such a frequent letter. So putting D on the index finger with T works very well for low SFB.

Why not the middle row? First, I think most people find it easier to reach up and down rather than laterally. Second, it works very well with the LD roll.

Why not the bottom row? I want to leave the bottom row the same as Qwerty for easy adoption and to leave the shortcuts of undo=cut-copy-paste the same. I also think C and M (the curl locations) are already near perfect frequencies for those locations. Those are the middle of the pack frequencies, which are perfect for the index fingers - which cover 6 to 7 letters.

I previously said that I’m not a fan of Colemak’s L position, which is the same upper-row-index-finger. But Colemak’s L has a ton of NFBs with the vowels, especially with E but also with all the other vowels. Looking at the whole hand, 62% of Colemak’s L bigrams are on the same hand. I think that’s a big source of discomfort. But with Middlemak’s D, only 22% of bigrams are on the same hand. So Middlemak has far lower same-hand-gymnastics.

### The R and L position

I’m sure the R and S location will attract attention, so I’ll discuss it more here.

If you want to skip this, the main factor is that R and L pair well together. Better than S and L. That means the RL column goes on the middle finger. R being more common goes on the home row, and L goes on the middle-finger-upper-row which is a strong location.

[First note that Colemak had to go with ARST because of F on the middle-finger-upper-row. The SFB of RF/FR is more common than SF/FS.]

#### ASRT, making a RL column

The pros of ASRT is it gives fewer SFB, with LR/RL being less than half as common as SL/LS. It also gives fewer ring-to-pinky-rolls with SA being far less common than Colemak’s RA. It also makes it much easier to learn from Qwerty.  

The cons is that the R position leads to more NFB with the index finger. Most of these feel ok but RD, GR, BR are not so good. These aren’t super common, but they are there. PR gives the commonly disliked lateral NFB, but I think it’s relatively ok for the frequency - it’s not super common. RS creates an outside roll, but I’d rather have the RS on Middlemak’s middle-to-ring fingers than Colemak’s RA on the ring-to-pinky fingers. Colemak’s RA is much more common than Middlemak’s RS too.

#### ARST, making a SL column

The pros of ARST is that it gives an inside roll of RS. It also separates R from the NFB letters on the index finger, which do add up. However, I’m trying to resolve the NFBs of Colemak’s right hand H and L with E which is a magnitude larger, in addition to the pinballing that it creates which requires moving L.

The cons with ARST is that it gives more SFB. It’s not huge, but it is there. It also gives a lot of ring-to-pinky outside rolls with RA. And finally this makes it much harder to learn coming from Qwerty.

#### Verdict: ASRT, RL column

None of these are huge deal breakers for one or the other. I went with lower SFB, lower ring-to-pinky rolls, and much easier to learn. At the cost of some NFB on the index finger and inside roll of RS.

(If someone comes from Colemak and wants ARST, they can. It's not a humongous downside to do that. Mostly the more common RA ring-to-pinky roll and slightly more SFB of SD/DS.)

(This layout truly does work better with ASRT. If it didn’t work, I would have changed it. For example, I wanted to keep G on its Qwerty location but it’s better to move it, so I didn’t shy away from changes.)

### P and G location

It’s better to move G than keep it in its Qwerty location.

P and G are pretty much the same frequency, so it doesn’t matter in that sense. 

P has a SFB with T, and it has common bigrams of PR, SP, and even PA. Those work better with P on the middle row. There is PL, but the ones above outweigh it.

G has a bigram with NG. With N on the opposite hand, that means G can go on the worse diagonal spot. There is GR, but PR is far more common.

### O location

O and E together give very low SFB. This is a great opportunity to put them together. The strong middle finger only has 3 keys, so it can handle two very frequent letters.

### U, Y and F locations

U works pretty well with I, the SFB are reasonably low. This location also creates a nice OU and YOU roll. 

Y goes to the index finger, which actually works pretty well. I broke down the numbers in SFB section. 

F goes to the right hand index finger, because putting P or G on the right hand gives too many SFB with M and N. The F location works quite well for both moderate frequency and low SFB. It has a lot of NFB with OF/FO, so placing it next to O makes a comfortable roll.
